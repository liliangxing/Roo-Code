# Phase 6: Background Task Visibility and Interaction

> Architectural design document for Issue #12330  
> Phase 6 of "Support parallel execution of specialized agents and improve context handoff between modes"

## 1. Context

Phase 5 (Background Tasks Panel UI) is complete. This document proposes the scope, priority, and architecture for Phase 6, which focuses on enabling better visibility and interaction with background tasks.

## 2. Current Architecture

### Task Lifecycle

`ClineProvider` maintains a `clineStack: Task[]` (LIFO). Only the top-of-stack task is "current" -- all state updates, webview messages, and user interactions route through `getCurrentTask()`.

```
ClineProvider
├── clineStack: Task[]          # LIFO stack, sequential execution
├── taskHistoryStore             # Per-task file persistence
├── getCurrentTask()             # Returns top of stack
├── addClineToStack(task)        # Push new task
└── removeClineFromStack()       # Pop completed task
```

### Task Persistence

| Layer | File | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| Messages | `taskMessages.ts` | Save/load `ClineMessage[]` per task |
| API History | `apiMessages.ts` | Save/load API conversation history |
| History Items | `TaskHistoryStore.ts` | Per-task metadata files with in-memory cache |
| Metadata | `taskMetadata.ts` | Task metadata helpers |

### Webview Communication

The extension sends typed `ExtensionMessage` objects to the webview. Key message types:

- `state` -- Full state snapshot (includes `clineMessages`, `currentTaskId`)
- `taskHistoryUpdated` -- Full history list refresh
- `taskHistoryItemUpdated` -- Single history item update

Currently, `postStateToWebviewWithoutTaskHistory()` sends state for only the current task. There is no mechanism to send updates for background tasks.

### Subtask Support

Parent-child relationships exist via `parentTaskId` and `childIds` on `HistoryItem`. The `new_task` tool creates subtasks that push onto the stack. When a subtask completes, it pops and returns control to the parent.

## 3. Agreed Scope for Phase 6

**In scope (Items 1-3):**
1. Full conversation replay for completed background tasks
2. Tab switching / multi-task view
3. Real-time progress streaming for active background tasks

**Deferred to Phase 7 (Items 4-5):**
4. Write-capable background tasks + basic file locking
5. Persistent background task history across sessions

## 4. Feasibility Analysis

### Item 1: Full Conversation Replay

**Complexity: Medium | Risk: Low**

`readTaskMessages(taskId, globalStoragePath)` already loads the full `ClineMessage[]` array from disk for any task. The existing `ChatView` component renders these messages. The main work is creating a read-only wrapper that:

- Accepts a `taskId` prop instead of reading from global state
- Loads messages on mount via a new webview message
- Hides input controls (chat box, approval buttons)
- Renders tool calls, outputs, and assistant responses in the same format

**Why it's low risk:** No changes to task execution, persistence, or the foreground task flow. Purely additive UI + a new message handler.

### Item 2: Tab Switching / Multi-task View

**Complexity: Medium-High | Risk: Medium**

The webview already has a tab system in `App.tsx` (`tab === "history"`, `tab === "settings"`, `tab === "chat"`). Adding a background tasks view requires:

- A new tab or panel within the chat view
- A list of active/completed background tasks with status indicators
- Navigation to open a task's replay view or live view
- State management to track which background task is currently being viewed

**Key challenge:** The webview currently receives state for only one task. Viewing a background task must not disrupt the foreground task's state. This requires either:
  - (a) A separate message channel for background task data, or
  - (b) A secondary state context in the webview that can hold background task data alongside the primary task state

Option (a) is cleaner and avoids polluting the existing state management.

### Item 3: Real-time Progress Streaming

**Complexity: High | Risk: Medium-High**

Currently, `Task.ts` calls `provider.postStateToWebviewWithoutTaskHistory()` to update the UI. This method sends the full state for the current task only. For background tasks to stream progress:

1. `Task.ts` must emit incremental updates even when it is not the "current" task
2. A new message type (`backgroundTaskProgress`) must carry task-scoped updates
3. The webview must handle concurrent update streams without degrading performance
4. Throttling/batching is needed to prevent excessive re-renders

**Why it's harder:** Requires changes to the core task execution loop (`Task.ts`), not just additive UI. The task currently assumes it IS the visible task when posting updates.

## 5. Recommended Priority Order

```
Phase 6a: Conversation Replay         (Foundation -- standalone value)
    │
    ▼
Phase 6b: Tab/Panel Switching          (Navigation framework, depends on 6a)
    │
    ▼
Phase 6c: Real-time Progress Streaming (Highest complexity, builds on 6b)
```

Each sub-phase is independently shippable and testable.

## 6. Detailed Design

### 6a. Conversation Replay

#### New Message Types

```typescript
// Webview → Extension
interface RequestBackgroundTaskMessages {
  type: "requestBackgroundTaskMessages"
  taskId: string
}

// Extension → Webview
interface BackgroundTaskMessages {
  type: "backgroundTaskMessages"
  taskId: string
  messages: ClineMessage[]
}
```

#### Extension Handler (webviewMessageHandler.ts)

```typescript
case "requestBackgroundTaskMessages": {
  const taskId = message.taskId
  const globalStoragePath = provider.contextProxy.globalStorageUri.fsPath
  const messages = await readTaskMessages(taskId, globalStoragePath)
  provider.postMessageToWebview({
    type: "backgroundTaskMessages",
    taskId,
    messages: messages ?? [],
  })
  break
}
```

#### Webview Component

```
BackgroundTaskReplayView
├── Props: { taskId: string, onClose: () => void }
├── State: messages (ClineMessage[]), loading (boolean)
├── On mount: sends requestBackgroundTaskMessages
├── On message: receives backgroundTaskMessages, filters by taskId
├── Renders: read-only message list (reuses ChatRow components)
└── No input controls, no approval buttons
```

### 6b. Tab/Panel Switching

#### UI Structure

```
App.tsx
├── tab === "chat"     → ChatView (foreground task)
├── tab === "history"  → HistoryView
├── tab === "settings" → SettingsView
└── tab === "bgTask"   → BackgroundTaskView
    ├── BackgroundTasksList (sidebar/panel)
    │   ├── Active tasks with status badges
    │   └── Completed tasks
    └── BackgroundTaskReplayView (from 6a) OR BackgroundTaskLiveView (from 6c)
```

#### State Management

```typescript
// New webview state (in App.tsx or dedicated context)
interface BackgroundTaskViewState {
  selectedTaskId: string | null
  viewMode: "replay" | "live"
}
```

#### Navigation Flow

1. User clicks background task icon/tab
2. App switches to `tab === "bgTask"`
3. BackgroundTasksList shows available tasks
4. User clicks a task → sets `selectedTaskId`
5. If task is completed → opens BackgroundTaskReplayView
6. If task is active → opens BackgroundTaskLiveView (Phase 6c)

### 6c. Real-time Progress Streaming (Minimal Viable Version)

> **Design principle:** Keep Phase 6c tightly scoped to avoid expanding the phase. Ship the simplest useful version first; richer detail can be added incrementally in later phases.

#### MVP Scope

The minimal viable version streams only:
- **Tool name + status** (started / completed / errored) -- not full parameters or output
- **Last N updates** (rolling window of ~20 items) -- older entries are discarded client-side
- **Status changes** (running, paused, completed, errored)

What is explicitly **out of scope** for the MVP:
- Full tool call parameters or output payloads
- Assistant text streaming
- Persistent storage of streamed updates (replay from disk covers completed tasks)

#### New Message Types

```typescript
// Extension → Webview (incremental updates)
interface BackgroundTaskProgress {
  type: "backgroundTaskProgress"
  taskId: string
  update: BackgroundTaskUpdate
}

interface BackgroundTaskUpdate {
  kind: "tool_call" | "tool_result" | "status_change" | "error"
  timestamp: number
  toolName?: string       // e.g. "read_file", "execute_command"
  status?: string         // e.g. "started", "completed", "errored"
  errorMessage?: string   // Only for kind === "error"
}
```

Note: `assistant_text` is excluded from the MVP. The update interface uses typed optional fields instead of `data: any` to keep the contract narrow and safe.

#### Task.ts Changes

Add a method that emits progress regardless of whether the task is "current":

```typescript
// In Task.ts
private emitBackgroundProgress(update: BackgroundTaskUpdate) {
  const provider = this.providerRef.deref()
  if (!provider) return
  
  // Only emit background updates when this task is NOT the current task
  if (provider.getCurrentTask()?.taskId === this.taskId) return
  
  provider.postMessageToWebview({
    type: "backgroundTaskProgress",
    taskId: this.taskId,
    update,
  })
}
```

The hook points in Task.ts should be minimal -- emit at tool call start and tool call end only. Avoid adding hooks inside the LLM streaming loop for the MVP.

#### Throttling Strategy

- Batch updates in 500ms windows (conservative default; can be tuned down later)
- Cap at 5 updates per batch per task
- Drop older updates if buffer exceeds threshold (keep last N = 20)
- Priority ordering: status_change > error > tool_result > tool_call

#### Webview: BackgroundTaskLiveView

```
BackgroundTaskLiveView
├── Props: { taskId: string }
├── State: updates (BackgroundTaskUpdate[], capped at last 20), status
├── Subscribes to backgroundTaskProgress messages filtered by taskId
├── Renders: compact list of recent tool calls with status icons
├── Auto-scrolls to latest update
└── Shows task status badge (running, paused, completed, errored)
```

The live view intentionally shows a compact summary, not a full chat transcript. Users who want full detail can wait for the task to complete and use the replay view (6a).

## 7. Testing Strategy

| Area | Test Type | Key Scenarios |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| Message handler | Unit (vitest) | Request/response for task messages, missing task, corrupt data |
| BackgroundTaskReplayView | Component (vitest + RTL) | Loading state, message rendering, empty state |
| Tab switching | Component (vitest + RTL) | Tab navigation, state preservation, back to foreground |
| Progress streaming | Unit (vitest) | Throttling, batching, concurrent tasks |
| Integration | E2E (if feasible) | Full flow: start bg task → view progress → replay after completion |

## 8. Open Questions

The following questions need alignment before implementation begins. They are grouped by area and ordered by impact.

### UI Layout

1. **Should the background task list be a sidebar panel or a tab?**

   | Option | Pros | Cons |
   |--------|------|------|
   | **Sidebar panel** (like Phase 5 panel) | Foreground task stays visible; quick glance at background status without context-switching | More complex layout; may feel cramped in narrow viewports |
   | **Full tab** (`tab === "bgTask"`) | Simpler implementation; full width for task details | Replaces the current view entirely; user loses sight of foreground task |
   | **Hybrid** (collapsible sidebar that can expand to full view) | Best of both worlds | Highest implementation effort |

   **Recommendation:** Start with a full tab for simplicity. If user feedback indicates they need to monitor background tasks while interacting with the foreground task, add a sidebar mode in a follow-up.

   **Decision needed:** Which option should we ship first?

2. **Where does the "background tasks" entry point live?**

   Options:
   - A new icon in the existing tab bar (alongside chat, history, settings)
   - A badge/button on the status area of the chat view
   - An entry in the history view with a filter for background tasks

   **Decision needed:** Which placement feels most discoverable without adding clutter?

3. **Should the replay view share the ChatView component or be a separate component?**

   Reusing `ChatView` with a read-only prop reduces duplication but may introduce coupling. A dedicated `BackgroundTaskReplayView` is more isolated but duplicates rendering logic.

   **Recommendation:** Create a thin wrapper around `ChatRow` components rather than reusing the full `ChatView`. This avoids inheriting input controls, scroll management, and approval button logic that don't apply.

### Progress Streaming Granularity

4. **What level of detail should the MVP stream?**

   | Level | What's shown | Bandwidth / perf cost |
   |-------|-------------|----------------------|
   | **Minimal** (recommended for MVP) | Tool name + status (started/completed/errored) | Very low |
   | **Medium** | Tool name + truncated first argument (e.g., file path) | Low |
   | **Full** | Complete tool parameters + output | High -- requires careful truncation |

   **Recommendation:** Ship with minimal level. The tool name and status provide enough signal to know "what the background task is doing right now" without performance risk. Medium level can be added as a fast follow if users want more context.

   **Decision needed:** Is the minimal level sufficient, or should we target medium from the start?

5. **Should streaming updates be opt-in?**

   If multiple background tasks are running, streaming all of them simultaneously could be noisy. Options:
   - Stream all tasks by default, throttle aggressively
   - Only stream updates for the currently-viewed background task
   - Let users toggle streaming per task

   **Recommendation:** Only stream updates for the currently-viewed background task (the one selected in the background task list). This keeps the implementation simple and avoids unnecessary message traffic.

   **Decision needed:** Confirm this approach or choose an alternative.

6. **How should errors in background tasks be surfaced?**

   When a background task hits an error, the user may not notice if they're focused on the foreground task. Options:
   - Badge/notification on the background tasks tab icon
   - Toast notification
   - Both

   **Recommendation:** Badge on the tab icon (low disruption). Toast notifications can be added later if users miss errors.

   **Decision needed:** Is a badge sufficient, or do we need more prominent notification?
